# Authentication Debug Guide

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Removed Promise.race with aggressive timeout**
- The 5-second timeout was too aggressive for slower connections
- Replaced with a proper timeout implementation using AbortController

### 2. **Fixed useEffect dependency issues**
- AuthProvider now runs initialization only once on mount
- Prevents multiple initialization attempts

### 3. **Added initialization guards**
- Prevents multiple concurrent initialization attempts
- Checks if already initialized before running

### 4. **Enhanced error handling and logging**
- Added detailed console logs for debugging
- Better error messages for timeout scenarios

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Test Supabase Connection
Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase

This will test:
- Supabase client initialization
- Authentication service connectivity
- Database connectivity
- Response times

### Step 2: Test App Without Auth
Visit: http://localhost:3000/debug

This bypasses authentication to test if the rest of the app works correctly.

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Look for these log messages:
- `[SUPABASE] Environment check:` - Confirms env vars are loaded
- `[AUTH] Starting authentication initialization...` - Auth process started
- `[AUTH] Getting session...` - Attempting to connect to Supabase
- Any error messages

### Step 4: Check Network Tab
In browser DevTools Network tab:
1. Look for requests to `supabase.co`
2. Check if they're timing out or returning errors
3. Check response times

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid or unexpected token" error
**Cause:** Syntax error in JavaScript
**Solution:** Already fixed by removing Promise.race syntax

### Issue: Auth stuck on "Checking authentication status..."
**Possible Causes:**
1. Supabase service is down or slow
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Incorrect environment variables
4. CORS issues

**Solutions:**
1. Test Supabase connection using the test endpoint
2. Verify environment variables are correct
3. Check if Supabase project is active and not paused
4. Try clearing browser cache and localStorage

### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure `.env.local` file exists
2. Restart the development server after changing env vars
3. Variables must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be available in the browser

## Next Steps

1. Run the app with `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase to test connection
3. Check browser console for detailed logs
4. If Supabase is working, the main app should now load
5. If not, visit http://localhost:3000/debug to use the app without auth

## Temporary Workaround

If authentication continues to fail, you can temporarily disable it:

1. In `app/page.tsx`, comment out lines 131-133:
```tsx
// <ProtectedRoute>
  <HomePage />
// </ProtectedRoute>
```

2. This will allow you to use the app while debugging the auth issue.

Remember to re-enable authentication before deploying to production!
